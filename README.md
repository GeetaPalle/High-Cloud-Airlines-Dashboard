# High Cloud Airlines – Business & Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes operational & financial data of High Cloud Airlines to provide insights into market trends, customer behavior, and airline performance. Using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, the project delivers interactive dashboards to help airlines optimize their routes, improve load factors, and increase profitability.

## Project Overview

Analyzed 111K flights across 209 airlines, connecting 1296 cities in 104 countries

Studied load factor (seat utilization) on a yearly, quarterly, and monthly basis

Compared weekend vs weekday travel patterns

Identified top airlines, busiest routes, and passenger trends

 ## Tools & Technologies

Excel → Data cleaning, pivot analysis, dashboard creation

Power BI → Interactive reports & KPI tracking

Tableau → Advanced visual storytelling & insights

SQL → Data extraction and transformation

## Key Insights

2011 had the best load factor among 2008–2013

Weekdays had higher passenger volume compared to weekends

Delta Airlines & Southwest Airlines ranked highest in load factor & transported passengers

Most flights were short-haul (<500 miles), with fewer long-distance routes

USA dominated with ~103K flights, far more than Mexico & Canada

## Recommendations

Add more weekday flights on busy US routes to capture demand

Adjust flight schedules using passenger travel patterns to maximize seat utilization

Focus on short-haul routes where demand is strongest
